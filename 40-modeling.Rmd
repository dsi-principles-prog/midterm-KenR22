In this section we will me applying the features to the data also selecting features in or out according to our necessity.

```{r loading_data_apply_feature_assert}
df <- diabetes %>% 
  cat_insulin %>%  ## categorise insulin
   assert(in_set(c(0,1)),insulin_cat) %>% ## Assert the cat_insulin function
  cat_bmi %>%
  assert(in_set(c(0,1,2,3)),bmi_cat) %>% # assert cat_bmi function
  select(outcome, everything())

df
```
