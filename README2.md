## Data Description

This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.

This dataset is licencsed under CC0:Public Domain.

Some of the data that are Diabetes, Glucose, Insulin Level, number of pregnanices and age. The column named "outcome" contains the value 0 and 1. 0 means no diabetes and 1 means not diabetes.

## Project Description

In this project machine learning will be used to predict if a woman have daibetes or not using the diagnostic measurements like  Glucose, Insulin Level, number of pregnanices and age.These will be our feature variable. Our target variable or the variable we want to predict  is "outcome" column.

This project have 3 notebooks.

1. 10-import: Files and library are imported in this notebook
2. 30-feature-engineering: Features are modified to make predictor aldorithms work better.
3. 40-modelling: In this file all the mdoels will be executed and evaluated.

This project is a binary classification machine learning problem. It means two classes(diabetes or not) needs to predicted from features.
